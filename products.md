NSDb is a time-series Database conceived having streaming real-time analytics in mind. Besides managing time-series data, it perfectly fits the read side of Kappa Architectures or systems based on Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern. Still, NSDB unifies the storage and retrieval of historical time-series data with real-time one. The plus is to store metrics and bind directly the incoming indexed data to the final users, thanks to pushing technologies like WebSocket.
